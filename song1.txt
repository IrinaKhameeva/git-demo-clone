In the land of the sunshine
People know how to groove
Making emotions
Believin' in what they do

Kalimba De Luna 
Take me tonight
Show me the way
To get right on time

E.O.U.A., on the rhythm
Gentle li ta los
E.O.U.A., on the rhythm
Gentle li ta los

Kalimba De Sol
Please talk to me
Lying is my life
Believin' in what you say
Hey, he, he, he, hey, ooh, oh, oh
